Please note: as of July 2021 your program will not work 
if you are using the latest version of configstore (6.0.0).  
to make this work you need to use the version of configstore Brad uses in his tutorial
 which is ^5.0.1.  in your package.json change the version, 
delete the configstore folder from your node_modules directory, and re-do npm install.
